# Online Interiors

This repository is a FiveM resource created by Cloudy that adds ipl/map edits, teleport's, and blips to the world of GTA 5.

This fork adds a fix for Franklin's mansion after the mpsecurity update, (courtesy of GTA5Mods member, katsutosh) as well as adds teleporters and blips for Diamond Casino & Resort, Los Santos Tuners, and the latest DLC, The Contract (aka mpsecurity).

----------------------

## Information - Cloudy

- I basically did all the work of coordinates and ipl interior editing so you don't have to.
- Please make sure to read the whole README for everything to work correctly.
- Since the last update, I have removed the map edits folder. To get the map edits go here: <https://github.com/cloudy-develop/online-interiors-maps>
- Online Interior Map Edits will remove some annoying obstructions around a few of the interiors.

### Note from Cloudy

- I wanted to do this because I've never really seen something with Teleports and Blips, without relying on ESX, VRP or other frameworks.
- I hope you can enjoy, I put in a lot of hours to complete this.
- Also, I put in a lot of work so please don‚Äôt go around saying you did all of this stuff, because you didn‚Äôt.

### Note from TayMcKenzieNZ

I admire Cloudy and Bob's efforts and by no means do I take any credit. I have simply continued their legacy in updating this resource for use with interiors featured in the Contracts DLC aka mpsecurity / 2545, as well as added fixes and additional props. These fixes and additions include:

- Added  additional chairs inside Franklin and MP offices

- Removed obstructing object from a TV prop on 2nd floor of Agencies, allowing players visible access when rendering videos to the screen via [pmms by Kibook](https://github.com/kibook/pmms) or other scripts.

- Changed sunlounger prop on music studio rooftop to work alongside [fivem scenarios script](https://github.com/kibook/fivem-scenarios)

- Replaced small TV in studio smoke room (with logos covering screen) with a better tv prop, allowing players visible access when rendering videos to the screen via hypnonema or other scripts

- Fixed Tuners exterior garage door from opening

- Removed annoying doors from penthouse office and penthouse cinema

- Removed tables and their respective collisions from agency 2nd floor living room and replaced with better table and props, allowing access to sir down and actually watch rendered content on the TV prop

- Added Lucky Wheel prop to Casino
