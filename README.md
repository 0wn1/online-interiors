# Online Interiors

This repository is a FiveM resource created by Cloudy that adds ipl/map edits, teleport's, and blips to GTA V.

This fork adds a fix for Franklin's mansion after the mpsecurity update, (courtesy of GTA5Mods member, katsutosh) as well as adds teleporters and blips for Diamond Casino & Resort, Los Santos Tuners, and the latest DLC, The Contract (aka mpsecurity).

----------------------

## Information - Cloudy

- I basically did all the work of coordinates and ipl interior editing so you don't have to.
- Please make sure to read the whole README for everything to work correctly.
- Since the last update, I have removed the map edits folder. To get the map edits go here: <https://github.com/cloudy-develop/online-interiors-maps>
- Online Interior Map Edits will remove some annoying obstructions around a few of the interiors.

### Note from Cloudy

- I wanted to do this because I never really saw something with Teleports and Blips and most of the working online interiors for people without ESX or VRP.
- I hope you can enjoy, I put in a lot of hours to complete this. Please expect there to be updates.
- Also, I put in a lot of work so please don’t go around saying you did all of this stuff, because you didn’t.

----------------------

### Note from TayMcKenzieNZ

- I admire Cloudy and Bob's efforts and by no means do I take any credit. I have simply continued their legacy in updating this resource for use with interiors featured in the Contracts DLC aka mpsecurity / 2545, as well as added fixes and additional props. These fixes and additions include:

- Added  additional chairs inside Franklin and MP offices

- Removed obstructing prop from a TV prop on 2nd floor of Agencies, allowing players visible access when rendering videos to the screen via [pmms by Kibook](https://github.com/kibook/pmms) or other scripts.

- Changed sunlounger prop on music studio rooftop to work alongside [fivem scenarios script](https://github.com/kibook/fivem-scenarios)

- Replaced small TV in studio smoke room (with logos covering screen) with a better tv prop, allowing players visible access when rendering videos to the screen via hypnonema or other scripts
